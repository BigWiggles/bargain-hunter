Online Store Script for Tampermonkey

Just a simple script that I've been working on for Tampermonkey that hunts through certain online stores looking for items and automatically
purchasing them. I started collecting older retro games and it's been continually getting harder to find them these days, so I started
making this to give me a bit of an edge over other collectors.
